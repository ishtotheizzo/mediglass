Open Source Medical Mirror 


# Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to provide an open source triaging tool for medical professionals to facilitate the intake and triage of patients.  

# Concept 

The current idea (it can change) is to have a mirror do all intake of patient stats:  Within the mirror there will be three main components: 

1. Input device itself
2. Software running on the hardware // running the ML model 
3. Application software
