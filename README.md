Open Source Medical Mirror 


# Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to provide an open source triaging tool for medical professionals to facilitate the intake and triage of patients.  

# Concept

1. Input device itself
2. Software running on the hardware // running the ML model 
3. Application software
